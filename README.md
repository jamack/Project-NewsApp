8th project in Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree course.

Project Description: The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to the student. Clicking a news story should open it in the user's web browser. Goals for this project: 1) Connecting to an API; 2) Parsing the response of the API; 3) Handling error cases gracefully; 4) Updating information regularly; 5) Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle.
